TODO: EXPLAIN YOUR SOLUTION

## Background
This project was developed in response to the 2016 NASA SpaceApps, [Asteroid Mining Challenge](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/solar-system/asteroid-mining), location: NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH

## 3D Models
Several 3d models were created for the purpose of generating animations to help explain the plan for obtaining a Near Earth Object for mining.  Those models are included in this project [here](MODELS.md)

## Resources Used for researching
The decisions, designs, and approaches used as part of this solution are based on research detailed in [these resources](RESOURCES-USED.md)
